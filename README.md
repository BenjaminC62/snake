# Snake Game in JavaFX

This project is a classic **Snake Game** developed in JavaFX. The game allows players to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items, with the goal of avoiding collisions with the snake's own body or the edges of the screen.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: The snake moves across the grid, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions.
- **Grid System**: The game uses two grids â€” one for the background and one for the player.
- **Timeline Animation**: Movement is managed using a JavaFX `Timeline` to ensure smooth and consistent animation.
- **Adjustable Speed**: The snake's speed can be adjusted based on the player's progress.
